# Movie Playlist Project

Person1: "Have you seen 'The movie everyone saw except you'?"
You: "no, why"
Person1 and 2 and 3: "What really, it's the best ever... can't beleive that a person exists that has not seen it..."

Search a movie and mark it to add to a list of titles that you still need to watch.
